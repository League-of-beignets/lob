This folder contains dummy files just to avoid http 404 status when the PenTest script will try to access to, f.i., dummy.asp.

These files should be blocked by aeSecure based on, for instance, the file's extensions : there are no reason to access to a .asp script on an Apache server.  The guy who are trying to do this is more than probably a hacker.   The presence of the file will then avoid the 404 page and allow to verify that aeSecure will correctly block this request.

These files will be requested by aeSecure when you'll start the PenTest application (http://yoursite/aesecure/tools/pentest/pentest.php?YOUR_LONG_KEY)
